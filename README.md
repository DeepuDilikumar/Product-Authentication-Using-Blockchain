# Product-Authentication-Using-Blockchain
Using blockchain technology to authenticate products and prevent counterfeiting


### 1. Cloning the repository 
	1.1  Clone the repository using the command:     
		'''
		git clone https://github.com/DeepuDilikumar/Product-Authentication-Using-Blockchain.git    
		'''
	1.2  Download all dependencies mentioned in package.json using the command:    
		npm install       
		(After executing, you should see 'node_modules' folder')    


### 2. Set up ganache (Blockchain for testing)    
	2.1. Open 'Ganache' and start a new workspace (name it anything, eg 'Product-Tracking'       
	2.2 Click 'Add Project' and add 'truffle-config.js' file and click 'start' on top right    
	2.3 Copy the private key of the first account given by Ganache       
	
	NOTE: In you truffle-config file, the port number mentioned in Ganache's Blockchain must be copied to the 'development's port' if not same          (mostly Ganache will give a port of 7545, but default value in truffle-config will be 8545, therefore has to be changed to 7545)     
	
	
### 3. Set up Metamask           
	3.1 Add metamask extention to google chrome       
	3.2 Add password and also save the 12 word private phrase    
	3.3 Import the first account from ganache to Metamask by using 'import option' and then pasting the copied private key of first account    
	3.4 You should see the ETH shown in ganache for that account in metamask as well. (Mostly 100 ETH)    
	
	
### 4. Deploying Smart Contract to Ganache             
	4.1 Use command: truffle migrate (recommended)          
	4.2 Can also use: truffle deploy       
	NOTE: You should see the number of blocks in blockchain (in Ganace) increase because the contracts are deployed in blockchain    
	
	
### 5. Starting the server (for manufacturer and dealer to login, etc)    
	5.1 Start the server using command:    
		nodemon server.js        
	    	(NOTE: install nodemon if not installed already)    
	5.2 Visit 127.0.0.1:8000/, and you should see a page asking to enter the product id to be shown.         

	
### --------APPLICATION SPECIFIC STEPS (PRODUCT TRACKING)--------       

NOTE: Need INTERNET access for certain functions to work, eg. the QR Code scanner, the js file is imported from a file in internet (jsQR)    

### 6. For manufactuer          
	6.1 Visit 127.0.0.1:8000/manufactuer/login -> login page       
	6.2 Visit 127.0.0.1:8000/manufactuer/add_product -> Adding product to mySQL database and the deployed blockchain    
	
	
### 7. For dealer    
	7.1 Visit 127.0.0.1:8000/dealer/login -> login page    
	7.2 Visit 127.0.0.1:8000/dealer/scan_qrcode -> Scanning the qrcode generated by manufactuer and getting the dealer's id and storing it to dealers passed variable in 'product structure' in ganache's blockchain    
	
	
### 8. For customer     
	8.1 Visit 127.0.0.1:8000/ -> Shows the page with a form field to enter the product id to be checked (which is deployed in blockchain)
